### AFFILIATE PROGRAM

Affiliate marketing has come to be known as something that happens online. You click a link, which directs you to a page or a product online, and then the link owner gets paid a small amount for that click. But it can also refer to things like when a mechanic gives a customer a discount for referring them to a new customer. The person who is doing the referring is getting paid by getting a discount towards their purchase. It is the same concept, just in the real world.

Affiliate marketing is a popular tactic to drive sales and generate significant online revenue. You can go with our program **Affilia Lite – Affiliate Program With MLM** if you are looking to promote your products or services.
